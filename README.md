# LAST BREATH

![Title](Screenshots/title.png)

Developed for the [Global Game Jam'25] at Lusofona University, with theme "Bubble".

## Game

In "Last Breath", humanity has gone underwater after an ecological disaster, but its tendencies followed.
Fight for resources to keep your city afloat, killing and stealing to maintain supremacy.

This is a two-player couch game where the players have to gather resources to supply air to their underwater city.

The game can be played with two gamepads or one gamepad and keyboard.

Controls:

|Control|Gamepad|Keyboard|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|Move	|Left analog|	WASD/Cursors|
|Fire Torpedos	|West button	|Ctrl|
|Gather Resources	|South button	|Space|
|Drop Resources|	East button|	C|

You can only carry one type of resource at a time, but no limit in the quantity you can carry. All resources have effects while being carried.

When you get destroyed, you'll respawn at your base after a bit. When your base runs out of oxygen, you can't respawn. If it runs out of oxygen, you can try to restore it, by spending some time at the base.

Game ends when one city is out of oxygen, and the associated player is dead.
